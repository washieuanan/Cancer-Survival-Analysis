In this study, we perform standard survival analysis using  Kaplan Meir Fitter Survival and COX Proportional Hazards, and finally use a gradient boosting model to see if we can predict survival of a patient based on their mutations. Two neural networks will also be applied to determine if neural networks are good classifiers for survival predictions. \n",

    "The National Cancer Institute runs the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), an extremely thorough repository of genomic and clinical data. This is an indispensable data repository for scientists and offers multiple data formats depending on a study of interest. There are many ways to download data from the GDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Download directly from the GDC portal. This is perhaps the easiest way to download data as the website interface is very simple, has many filters to help find data quickly, and is also a good way to visualize data. However, for the purpose of demonstrating how data can be downloaded programmatically, this method will not be employed (except to download the clinical .tar file first). Additionally, in the case of downloading multiple datasets, using the website interface can be tedious. \n",
    "   2. Using the GDC client. The GDC has a data download tool that can download multiple datasets if one has a manifest file. A manifest file can be downloaded from the GDC portal after selecting what cancer types, file types, and other features one desires. This is very useful if someone wants to download many clinical and mutation files. \n",
    "   3. Using the GDC API. The GDC has built an API that can be used with Python to download any file. The file is downloaded onto the user's computer. The user can then access the file from their computer and load it into a kernel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The method that will be used is (3), the GDC API. Since only 2 cancer types will be examined for the purpose of this project, the API is a good way to download data programmatically. In order to download desired data, UUIDs will be required. A UUID is a special identification number for any file on the GDC repository. This number can be accessed once clicking on a file on the GDC portal. It can also be accessed from a manifest file if one is to download multiple datasets at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will examine two cancer types: Breast and Skin. For each of these cancer types, we will use data collected by the Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA). TCGA data is very thorough is used by many bioinformaticians. There are two file types will require for survival analysis and survival prediction: clinical and mutation. The purpose of and data in each file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Clinical: clinical files have patient ids (unique alpha-numeric identification key), some patient information like date of birth, vital status (whether patient is alive or dead), days since last follow up or diagnosis, information regarding cancer cells, cancer stage, and information about some possibly related diseases. Many of these files are closed access and can only be obtained if one is given special permission by the NIC. We will only be using open access data. This file does not contain patient's names or locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Mutation file: mutation files contain information regarding mutated genes collected from the same patients listed in clinical files. These files have the same patient ids as in clinical files, but focus on mutated genes, site of mutation, type of mutation, region of mutation, and impact of mutation. These datasets are fairly large and contain information regarding some non-relevant mutations. Therefore, some filtering will be employed to only use mutation information for the most prevalent and high impact mutations. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Clinical files can only be retrieved through the portal or by using the GDC client tool. For the purpose of this project, the GDC portal will be used for downloading the clinical files. The mutation files will be downloaded using the API."

    "Now, we can begin plotting survival curves. These curves shows the fractions of patients alive as time passes onto the end of the study. We need to understand something important about our data first, however. In our dataset, we don't know exactly when the patients actually started having cancer. We know how long it has been since they have been diagnosed with cancer and the amount of time to the end of the study or to their death. Thus, our data is known to be left censored. This is an important consideration to take into account when making survival curves and hazard curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is important to realize that for every gene mutation, we may not see survival curves for each mutation of interest complete to the end of total duration. For example, the survival curve for one mutation may end abruptly before the end of the study period. This is either because no more patients with that particular died after a certain point in the study or patient data for patients with that gene mutation stopped being collected."

    "As we can see, the three genes seem to show similar hazard curves. However, notice that the error for the DNAH5 curve is much larger than that of the others. This is probably because DNAH5's effect on patient survival varies much more greatly from patient to patient. Also notice, the curve end abruptly. It is interesting that the hazard functions are similar for all three gene mutations. This suggests that although TTN and MUC16 are the most prevelant gene mutations in patients with skin cancer, they aren't necessarily the most important gene mutation leading to death for every patient. This hazard curve may suggest that the other gene mutation may actually have as much of an effect on skin cancer patient survival as TTN and MUC16!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our survival analysis has allowed us to see the effects of three mutated genes on skin cancer patient survival. We knew that the TTN and MUC16 gene mutations are most prevelant. However, our analysis showed us that some other gene mutations may also be of importance in skin cancer. We were able to use patient clinical data and mutation data to come to this important conclusion.\n"

    "Now, we will make a few machine learning models to predict skin cancer patient survival. The purpose of this study is to determine if we can use patient tumor stage, duration, and gene mutation type to predict vital status. The value of this study is that it allows for us to determine whether or not a patient is expected to survive given their tumor stage and gene mutation. This is very important in clinical settings because it may ultimately impact the administration of life saving medications and save lives. \n",

    "Three kinds of machine learning approaches will be utilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Boosting Machine: a gradient boosting machine is a decision tree based alogorithm that can be used for classification or regression purposes. Using decision trees, the model constantly adjusts predictions in order to minimize loss determined by the inputted loss function. This model is very powerful as it doesn't just fit data to a model, it also constantly updates the model using gradient descent. This is a supervised learning approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multilayer Perceptron: scikit-learn offers its own version of a built in neural network called MLPClassifier. It is similar to the neural network, but it is worth seeing if it can outperform the neural network made with keras. Using GridSearchCV will also help determine the best paramters for the neural network made with Keras (below).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Neural Network with Keras: a neural network has many layers that will approximate weights for the inputted data to ultimately reach a conclusion. The weights will be updated overtime to fit the data to the proper classifications. Neural networks can be made with any number of layers, and the ideal model varies from use case to use case. In this case, we will be doing supervised learning with a neural network. \n",

    "Machine learning models, including neural networks, can't work with strings. Note that the 'tumor_stage\" column and \"Hugo_Symbol\" or \"Entrez_Gene_Id\" fields are also string values. Thus, they must be encoded into numbers for use in our models. Additionally, the duration time must converted to negative values for patients who are alive as positive values for duration are only meant for patients who have died. This is because the duration is means how much time has passed since death. This distinction wasn't important for our survival analysis as the lifelines library we used is able to interpret this information given vital_status. Our models won't be able to do this, so we need to preprocess our dataset to ensure our data represents proper duration times. "

    "Since this is a classification problem, it is important to determine three metrics: precision, recall, and the F1 Score. The precision tells us of those that are labeled as dead are actually dead. The recall tells us of those who are actually dead, how many of those we correctly predicted. The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into one statistics. Specificity is another metric to consider, and it tells us: of all the people are still alive, how many we correctly predicted. Accuracy measures how many classifications were correct. When it comes to binary classifications, especially with the skewed dataset we have, accuracy doesn't tell us much about the predictive power of our models. Rather, precision, recall, and the F1 score will tell us how good our models are at properly predicting a patient's vital status. The ROC curve AUC score is also a good metric to use to determine how good of a classifier our classifier is. An AUC closer to 0.5 means a classifier that is less able to make proper binary classifications. An AUC closer to 1 indicates a good binary classifier. "

In fact, looking at the confusion matrix, training on this dataset with xgboost distrubuted classifications a lot. This may be because we have such few datapoints to train on. It may also be because we trained using multiple gene mutations. Regardless, it is clear that tumor stage is more important, so the number of gene mutations may not play much of a role.

Thus, our model is not very good at determining survival status of patients based on their survival time, mutated gene, and tumor stage. Note that the accuracy on our breast cancer dataset was much higher. This change suggests that this model works better on one dataset than another.

    "\n",
    "This neural net also performed very poorly like the last one. This final model makes it clear that what was to blame for low performance in classifying skin cancer was not the skew in the dataset. It was really the number of datapoints available to us. Since the balanced dataset uses under 400 data points, there is not sufficient learning on any of these models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Will neural networks be useful in clinical situations? If they are trained on many more data points(thousands to millions), they can be amazing classifiers. Neural networks are often used for image classification in the cinical setting, so their value in patient survival classification may be of great use to clinicians. However, clincians may prefer more interpretable models."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The survival analysis portion of this study demonstrated that the TTN, MUC16, BRAF, DNAH5, and PCLO gene mutations may actually be of significant interest to clincians for the treastment of skin cancer. There weren't any remarkable findings with this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning compononent of this project provided some interesting insights into how data composition and size can ultimately impact model strength. This skin cancer dataset was clearly very different from the breast cancer dataset. Not only were there much fewer datapoints to train with, but the dataset was more balanced. The same models were used in the analysis and classification modeling of both datasets. However, very different results were obtained. Even though the breast cancer dataset was far more skewed than this one, the models were able to become better classifiers on breast cancer data than on skin cancer data. The MLPClassifier trained on the balanced dataset is the best classifier given its AUC score. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the huge discrepancy in predictive power mainly lies in the small number of datapoints available in the skin cancer dataset. Machine learning models require the use of many data points to come to useful predictions. This further drives home the point that, in order for machine learning to be useful in clinical settings, models must be trained on a large number of data points. "
